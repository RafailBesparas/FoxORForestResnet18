# Problem Statement 
In 2015, a complex challenge was posed to determine whether an image contained a bird or a forest. Building on this, I am using the ResNet algorithm to develop a model that can predict whether an image depicts a fox or a forest.

# The idea behind the project
The idea originated from the first video lecture by the FastAI team, where Jeremy Howard, a renowned scientist, discusses transfer learning and highlights the remarkable advancements in deep learning.
